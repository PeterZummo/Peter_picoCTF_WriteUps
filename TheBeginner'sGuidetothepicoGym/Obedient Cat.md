## Step 1 of 1 | Easy Peezy
Hello, This is my first CTF write up! This challage includes downloading a file called ![flag](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/fb851c1858cc762bd4eed569013d7f00/flag).

When attempting to download the flag in Windows, we see it downloads it as flag.file and all we have to do to get the flag is open the file in notepad!

If we wanted to do it the cool way, we can also use linux, running a linux machine (either the picoCTF provided one or you created) we can use **wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/fb851c1858cc762bd4eed569013d7f00/flag** then **cat flag** to read the file revealing the flag!
